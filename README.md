ClaferIDE
=========

v0.3.9

A web-based IDE for Clafer.

ClaferIDE is part of Clafer Tools.
Read more in the paper [Clafer Tools for Product Line Engineering](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/publications/view/519).

### Live demo

* Master branch (stable and released): [Try me!](http://t3-necsis.cs.uwaterloo.ca:8094/)
* Develop branch (with latest features, but may be unstable): [Try me!](http://t3-necsis.cs.uwaterloo.ca:8194/)

If the demo is down or you encounter a bug, please email [Michal Antkiewicz](mailto:mantkiew@gsd.uwaterloo.ca).

### Background

See [clafer.org](http://clafer.org).

### Functions

1. Provides a web-based IDE for modeling in Clafer
2. Provides an source code editor (ACE)
2. Compiles the model to HTML for syntax highlighting and navigation via hyperlinks or error highlighting
3. Instantiates the model using ClaferIG and allows for global scope setting and requesting a next instance
4. Provides a set of predefined examples that can be compiler and instantiated

### Nature

ClaferIDE is a web-based application.
Its server side (implemented with `Node.js`) processes requests, runs the chosen back-end and passes back its output.
The client-side is implemented using `Javascript/HTML` and handles all the IDE functionality.

Installation and running
------------------------

### Dependencies for running

* [Java Platform (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) v8+
* [Clafer](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer) v0.3.9
  * can be from the binary distribution
* [Node.js Framework](http://nodejs.org/download/), v0.12.0
* [Redis Server](https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/ubuntu/redis-server), v2:2.*
  * On Ubuntu, execute `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/redis-server && apt-get install redis-server`
* Backends' dependencies must be satisfied. See the backend installation steps below.

### Installation

**Core**

1. Download (`git clone`) [ClaferIDE](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferIDE) to some directory `<target directory>`
2. Go to `<target directory>/ClaferIDE` and execute

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

This will install the platform.

3. Go to `<target directory>/ClaferIDE/Server` and execute

`npm install`

This will download all the required `Node.js` modules.

4. Install the necessary backends into some location `<bin>` found on `PATH`. The default configuration in `<target directory>/ClaferIDE/Server/Backends/backends.json` assumes `~/bin`.

The fastest way is to unzip a binary distribution into the folder `<bin>`.

See [Installing Backends](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferToolsUICommonPlatform#backends) for detailed steps.

### Settings

1. Make sure the port `8194` is free, or change the value of the key `port` in `Server/config.json`:
`"port" = "8194"` to any free one.

2. Make sure `clafer`, `node`, `python`, and `java` are in `PATH` environment variables, so they can be executed without any path prefixes.

3. Running the following commands should produce the following results or later version:

`clafer -V`

> `Clafer v0.3.9`

`java -version`

> `java version 1.8.0_40`

`node -v`

> `v0.12.0`

4. Make sure `uploads` folder is accessible for writing, since temporary files will be stored there.

5. If you use Shell scipts (`.sh`) for running, make sure the scripts have `Execute` permissions.

### Running

* To run the server in a standard mode, execute

`cd <target directory>/ClaferIDE/Server/`

`node ClaferIDE.js`

* If you use `Node Supervisor` under Linux, you can execute

`cd <target directory>/ClaferIDE/Server/commons`

`sh start.sh`

Then you can go to any browser and type `http://localhost:[port]/` and open any Clafer file with objectives in it.

### Trying an Example

* Choose `Simple model of a Person` example in the dropdown box in the upper-left corner of the tool window.
* Press `Compile` button right in the front of the drop down list.
* Once you see the compilation is complete, go to `Instance Generator` view and press `Run` there (the default backend is `Alloy-based IG (IG only)`).
* The `Output` view should print the first generated instance.

### Important: Branches must correspond

All related projects are following the *simultaneous release model*.
The branch `master` contains releases, whereas the branch `develop` contains code under development.
When building the tools, the branches should match.
Releases from branches `master` are guaranteed to work well together.
Development versions from branches `develop` should work well together but this might not always be the case.
